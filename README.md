### Hey, my name is RandomboiXD (But RandombX is my name that i use a lot... don't ask why.)
-- --

The main language i write my stuff in is python, i know its... slow but it is somethin'.

Other than that, mostly the repos i work in are private, though i published some repos that contain some of my oldest projects...

Github for me is like... a place where i store stuff, uhm yeah you won't really see me do a pull request on a public repo... yeaaaaaaaaaah.

Anyway, i pinned some repos if ya wanna look into things that i made, ‚ö†Ô∏èwarning: my code is like üçù2.0 soooooooooooooooo yeah have fun i guess :D
